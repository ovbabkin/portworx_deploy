= Portworx Subscriptions Overview

Three factors play an important part in selecting the right product subscription:

* The (Service Level Agreement) SLA
* The number of (physical) Sockets and VCPU
* The number of Virtual Machines.
* Raw storage capacity


== Service Level Agreement
An important part of a subscription is access to Digital IQ support. The SLA associated with a subscription plays an important part for the customer here as this defines response times.
